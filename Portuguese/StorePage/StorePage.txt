Carefully tuned, physics based car handling is in the sweet spot between arcade and sim, easy to handle, difficult to master. Learn to handle and drift your cars on different surfaces, feel when your car loses grip and regains traction.

Daily Challenge and Time Attack mode will let you race against other player ghosts. Skill is the only thing that will get you to the top of the Leaderboards.
